```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## Syntax 

* Lower caps
* `_` not `.`
* If you override the default value of an argument, use the full name `mean(1:10, na.rm = TRUE)`
* Indent code inside `{}` with two spaces. 
* Space after a comma, never before
* Place a space before `(`, except when itâ€™s part of a function call.
* 80 characters per line
* Use `<-` not `=` for assignment.
* Use `"` not `'` for quoting text. 

## Functions

* Use verbs for function names `calc_means()`
* Indent multi-line functions by start of decription
* Only use `return()` for early returns.
* A function should do one thing well.
* A function should be called either because it has side-effects or because it returns a value; not both. 
* Strive for 20-30 lines per function are common. 
* A function should be easily understandable in isolation.
* If you *have* to use global options, clean up with `on.exit()`.


## Pipes

* 3 nested functions? Use `%>%`
* After first pipe, indent each line by two spaces.
* Always show the brackets. ` %>% unique()`
* Seperate line for assignment
